# triplsi

[TRIPLSI Website] (https://triplsi.com) with pure CSS built during [Jonas's Advanced CSS course](https://www.udemy.com/advanced-css-and-sass).

JavaScript used just to console.log the Hello message and a little bit of jQuery to close the menu when menu item is clicked.

Feel free to use the theme but please mention Jonas as a designer and author. Tnx.
